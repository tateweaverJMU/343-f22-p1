        <h2>Beginnings</h2>

        <p>Fortnite was initially released in early access on September 26, 2017, for Windows, macOS, 
            PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, followed by ports for iOS, Android, and Nintendo 
            Switch the following year. Initially a PvE game, the Battle Royale mode took the gaming
            world by storm. As the game expanded and updated throughout time, the unexpected lore of Fortnite began.

            <p>
                Chapter 1 was the first chapter of Fortnite and had a massive story, and over the course of the Chapter, new cosmetics, 
                vehicles and locations were added. Chapter 1 consisted of 10 whole seasons with lots of new things added as well as many 
                things getting removed.

            <p>
                The first large event that occured was the appearence of a meteor in the sky over the island. Players speculated on what
                this meant. After some time, the meteor struck the island, bringing in an out of this world theme. From this chaos, an evil villan
                Omega appeared.
