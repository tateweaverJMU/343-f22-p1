  <ol>
    <li>Our site contains 5 different HTML pages: index.html, history.html, figures.html, skinsDances.html, strategies.html</li>

    <li>We have a favicon declared. The IMG is FS.jpeg</li>

    <li>Each of the pages on our website contain a header with an image that is meaningful and relevant to the side</li>

    <li>Our site contains a Top Nav bar with links that help the user navigate to the other pages on the site.</li>

    <li>Each of our css files include media queries to support large and small screens. We have comments in the css files where this is done.</li>

    <li>We have images spread all across our pages, with alt descriptions to describe each one. The images are all kept in the images directory</li>

    <li>We have a general style sheet named style.css, and then each page has an individual stylesheet to be unique.</li>

    <li>Our headers are sans-serif and the content of the pages are in serif font.</li>

    <li>On the index.html page, we have a form that supposedly would allow a user to input a username and password to create an account.
      It does not do anything at this time as specified by writeup. 
    </li>
    
    <li>On the bottom of each page has a link to the official fortnite site. Also some of our pages include youtube links.</li>
