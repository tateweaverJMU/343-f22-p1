        <h2>1. Ninja</h2>
            <p>Richard Tyler Blevins, better known as Ninja, is an American Twitch streamer, YouTuber 
                and professional gamer. Blevins began streaming through participating in several esports teams 
                in competitive play for Halo 3, and gradually picked up fame when he first started playing Fortnite 
                Battle Royale in late 2017. He was a fan favorite and really helped the game get popular. Fortnite 
                even rewarded him with his own signature skin and dances in-game.
