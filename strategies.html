        Building is what sets Fortnite apart from most other pvp games. Fortnite consists of building
        and repairing basic structures such as walls, floors, stairs, and roofs, as well as placement of traps.
        

        <h2>2. Resource Farming</h2>

        Creating structures requires basic building Materials, which are Wood, Stone, and Metal. These resources 
        can be obtained through harvesting or destroying objects by eliminating another player and taking their loot.



        <h2>3. Replenish Health and Shield</h2>

        Fortnite contains health resources as well as shield resources. Each player drops into the game with 100 health points
        and can obtain up to 100 shield points during the game from shield potions. Regular shield potions give 50 points and a small shield 
        potion gives up to 25 shield points. Bandages and MedKits can increase and replenish health points.
